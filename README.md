# Self Driving Car by Kevin Koh

This project has largely been inspired by gniziemazity (link can be found here https://github.com/gniziemazity/Self-driving-car)

The mechanics of the cars, roads, etc. have all been heavily inspired by his implementation, but the difference between the two projects would be the implementation of the AI algorithm. gniziemazity decided on using a Genetic Algorithm, which he coded himself, I opted for a Reinforcement Learning algorithm, as I believed that because the environment is dynamic (traffic spawning in at random, along with some ideas for future development such as various scenarios like parking, wet floor, sharp bends, etc.), Reinforcement Learning because of this continuous action space.
